        This platform is a Breakout game in which the player must smash a wall
        of lamps by deflecting the shield from the sword. The sword may move
        horizontally and is controlled with the help of Arrow Keys. The player
        gets 3 lives to start with; a life is lost if the shield hits the bottom
        of the screen. When all the lamps have been collected , the player
        advances to a new, harder level. There are 3 levels. As the level
        advances,the quantity of lamps increase. If all lives are lost, the game
        is over. There are special lamps, which give a boost in power if
        collected or may lower the speed of the shield.
